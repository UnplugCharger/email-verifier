A tool for email verification

Email verification tools automatically validate the authenticity of email addresses to help minimize bounce rates. They filter out incorrect addresses to increase deliverability and improve the performance of email campaigns.

How Email Verification Works
Email verification is a process of verifying emails involving a series of steps that can help you improve your email deliverability.

The following is the general process on how email verification works, although different verification services have different steps and verification methods.

First, it identifies any issues and possible problems before they’re caught by ISPs or ESPs.

It’s actually just like spellcheck – making sure you haven’t misspelled anything before handing in that paper that’s due in 15 minutes.

Email verification usually involves checking your mailing list for spam traps – email addresses which have been created with the intention of capturing senders who aren’t following proper practices.

If you’ve been buying mailing lists, chances are you’ve got a few of them. But even if you’ve legitimately acquired email addresses, there can be one or two of spam traps on there.

Email verification makes sure that these addresses are removed from your mailing lists. Otherwise, if you send an email to a spam trap, you’ll either be asked to remove that address from your list, or you’ll be blacklisted by ISPs and ESPs.

The next thing that happens with email verification is that the provider checks the format of your emails (formatting & syntax check). This includes scanning your mailing list for missing @ symbols, invalid email addresses, and other things that could result in a hard bounce.

For example, if someone put in this email address: john@john@dd, this is where email verification would catch it.

The next step of the process is domain verification. The service checks the DNS records to make sure that the domain name is correct, and that the domain mail exchange server is able to receive emails.

For example, if someone entered this email address: john@johnski.dd, if there’s no domain registered under johnski.dd, email verification would mark it as not valid at this point.

### Not Implemented

The final step of the process is individual mailbox validation. For this, email verification services use the SMTP protocol to make sure that the mailbox exists and is able to receive messages.

Let’s use our John for this example, too. Let’s say John made a mistake and instead of writing john@johnski.dd he wrote: jehn@johnski.dd. The email verification would at this step send a signal to verify whether this mailbox is able to receive messages. Once it’s clear it can’t, you’d be notified that the email address is not valid.
